## Tic-Tac-Toe

  In this game each player picks a symbol to represent them, “X’s” or “O’s”.
  Alternating turns, each player picks one empty space and writes their symbol in it.
  The first player to get 3 in a row horizontally, vertically or Diagonally wins.
  Once all the spaces are filled, if there is no winner, then it is a tie.


*NOTE :* Correct file paths if neccessary and add your own favicon.
